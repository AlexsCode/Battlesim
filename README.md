A Battle Calculator for Eve online

<b>Purpose:</b>
Often in virtual warfare and real warfare it is more than just a numbers game.
This tool is to help newer strategists understand the difference between a "winable" engagement and a lost hope.

<b>How to use:</b>
Input the current fleet composition of ships you have, and then the opposition composition.
Change the Ammo types, ranges etc and see how the metrics work out to best see expected outcomes.

<u> Future Plans/Progress:</u>
* Basic UI - completed.
* Reading ship data/comp - completed however switching to mySQL backend rather than reading from txt files.
* Add Weapon range selection Graphic.
* Auto Calculate ships remaining.
* Be able to copy and paste the data(Comp) from functions within Eve online.
* Graphs to show Damage/Time and break down of the battle.
